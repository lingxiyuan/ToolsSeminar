\section{Installation and configuration}
The SymPy CAS can be installed on virtually any computer with Python 2.7 or above. SymPy does require mpmath Python library to be installed first, so it is recommanded to use Anaconda as it already includes mpmath and
other useful packages which could extend sympy's utilities. An alternative choice is to use \,\,$\bm{git\ clone\ git://github.com/sympy/sympy.git}$\,\, from the command line if you want to get the lastest updates as they come.
Besides, an installation executable (.exe) is available for Windows users at the \href{https://github.com/sympy/sympy/releases}{downloads site}.

\section{Resources}
The offical documentation is provided \href{http://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/index.html}{here}. To get more
details, view the \href{http://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/index.html}{Sympy Modules Reference}. There is also
\href{http://ju.outofmemory.cn/entry/80895}{a simple chinese version} of Sympy tutorial if you think the offical tutorial is too cumbersome. 

\section{Assignment}
\begin{partlist}
\item \textbf{(Required)} set the printer of the interactive enviroment you are using (especially, jupyter notebook) to print $\int_{2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{xlog^2x}dx$ in latex and then compute this integral.
\item \textbf{(Required)} apply recurrence formula $I_{n}=1-n*I_{n-1}$ to calculate $I_{20}=\frac{1}{e}\int_{0}^{1}x^{20}e^x dx$ with pure python and sympy, explain the difference between the answers.
\item \textbf{(Required)} use sympy to solve ODE $y^{'} = (1-\frac{y}{10000})*y$, and then plot the solution with $C=-1000, -10000, 0.3, 0.7$ (C is the constant in the solution)
\item \textbf{(Optional)} find the minimum point for function $f(x,y)=x^3+y^3-3x-12y$
